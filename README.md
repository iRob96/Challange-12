## Overview of the Analysis

In this section, describe the analysis you completed for the machine learning models used in this Challenge. This might include:

* We ran logistic regression models to predict approvals on loans. We took the data from the lending_data.csv which included all the basic varibles that goes into approval odds. We used the value_counts function which gave us O's nd 1's (basically yes or no's) on which loans were approved . The Logistic regression model used the actual data we were given and we also ran a resampling method which used some random numbers to show the accuarcy.


## Results

Using bulleted lists, describe the balanced accuracy scores and the precision and recall scores of all machine learning models.

* Machine Learning Model 1: Logistic Regression
  * Accuracy- 95%
  * Precision- 99%
  * Recall scores-99%



* Machine Learning Model 2: Resampling
  * Accuracy- 99%
  * Precision- 99%
  * Recall scores-99%


## Summary


Although both models were fairly accuarate, I would recommend using the resampling learning model because the accuracy is higher. Perfrormance doesn't depend on the problem long as the data is correct we would be able to solve for many diffrent outcomes.
